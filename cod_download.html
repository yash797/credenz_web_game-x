            <h2>Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. A version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has been announced to be released in 2022,
                with a mobile version also in development as of 2022.[1][2] The game is a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War, 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard and the sequel of Modern
                Warfare coming in 2022 (but does not require purchase of either titles) and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content. Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software (the latter later credited as the sole developer
                following the integration of Cold War's content) and published by Activision.[3] Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. Other modes include Plunder, Rebirth:
                Resurgence, Buy Back, Payload and Clash. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between three games.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p> The game features two main modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system that can be used at "Buy Stations" in and around the map. "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited
                access to players ' custom classes (which were shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes prior to Season 6, v1.29, but now are unique to Warzone). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks. Cash
                can be found by looting buildings and killing players that have cash on them. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players. However, in free post-launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added
                to the game. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, with the maps receiving specific praise. In April 2021, Activision announced that Warzone had surpassed 100 million active players.</p>
